When your mind wanders, pause and return to the last sentence you remember. Reading is an invitation to notice, not a race to finish.\n\nTry this today: choose a comfortable place, silence one distraction, and read for five minutes. Stop while you still feel curious.

If a passage feels important, reread it slowly. Put the idea into your own words instead of trying to remember every sentence.\n\nAt the end of a session, name one thing that surprised you. That small act of reflection gives the next reading session a place to start.",

Keep a list of books you want to read, books you are reading, and books you want to discuss. These lists belong to you: there is no correct size or required pace.\n\nIt is also fine to set a book aside. A book that does not fit today may find its moment later.

Avoid giving away a major ending unless the reader has asked for it.\n\nMost of all, let reading connect to the rest of life.
